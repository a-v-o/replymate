## ReplyMate usage

This app lets you paste Tweet URLs and write one or more replies (one per line). For each reply the app generates a "Reply" button that opens Twitter's web intent with your reply prefilled and the tweet set as the in-reply-to target.

How to use:

- Open the homepage.
- Paste a tweet URL (e.g. `https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890`) and type replies in the textarea (one per line).
- Click "Add tweet". Buttons will appear for each reply. Click a button to open the Twitter reply composer with your text.

Notes:

- The app uses the Twitter/X web intent (https://twitter.com/intent/tweet) and opens it in a new tab.
- Replies longer than ~260 characters are truncated to keep them under Twitter's limits.
